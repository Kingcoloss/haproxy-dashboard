## üìã Description
HAProxy Configurator offers a rich GUI to create, validate, and manage HAProxy configurations. Features include frontend/backend setup, health checks, ACLs, SSL, WAF rules, and more ‚Äî all without manually editing `haproxy.cfg`.

---

## ‚úÖ Requirements

1. **Root or sudo privileges**
2. **HAProxy** installed on your system
3. **Python 3**
4. Port `5000` must be available (for the web interface)


## Install:

1. clone the repository:
   ```git clone https://github.com/alonz22/HAProxy-Configurator```

2. Install pip (if not installed already):

- for ubuntu:
  ```apt install python3-pip```
  
- RedHat:
  ```yum install python3-pip```


3. enter the root folder of the app:
   ```cd haproxy-configurator```
   
4. Install flask and the app dependencies by simply run the Makefile in the cli:
   ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

5. run the installation script:
   ```chmod +x install.sh```
   
if the script failes to run with "bad interpreter" error, run the following:
   - ```sed -i 's/\r//' install.sh```
   - ```./install.sh```

6. the path of the root directory of the app should be located now at ```/etc/haproxy-configurator```

7. run ```service haproxy-configurator status``` to see if the service is running.


8.browse the app:
   ```browse https://your-haproxy-server-ip:5000```

## SSL Certificate

The application comes with a self signed certificate related to tthe domain "haproxy-configurator.local". The path to the PEM file can be changed inside ssl.ini configuration file.

## Usage
Launch the HAProxy Configurator by navigating to https://your-haproxy-server-ip:5000.

Fill in the required parameters and options for your HAProxy configuration.

## Roadmap Overview


### Performance and Flexibility

1.HTTP Keep-Alive Option: Implement an option to enable HTTP Keep-Alive within the frontend configurations. This feature enhances connection efficiency by allowing multiple requests and responses to be sent over a single TCP connection.

2.Backup Servers for Backend: Enhance backend resilience by adding support for specifying backup servers. These servers will be used when the primary servers are unavailable, improving overall service availability.

3.Dynamic Backend Server Addition: Introduce an intuitive button to dynamically add backend servers directly from the GUI, eliminating the need to manually edit configuration files.

### Phase 3: Optimizations and Security

1.Frontend Caching Mechanism: Implement a frontend caching mechanism to optimize content delivery and reduce backend load. This feature will help accelerate user experiences and decrease response times.

2.Advanced WAF Protection: Bolster our existing WAF features with a more robust and comprehensive set of protections against emerging threats. Enhancements will include:

* Advanced SQL injection detection and prevention
* Enhanced XSS attack mitigation
* Fine-grained controls for blocking sensitive data leaks
* Improved anomaly detection for DOS attacks
